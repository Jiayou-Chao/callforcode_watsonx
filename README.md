## Deliverable: Describe how IBM watsonx product(s) would be used

- [Text Embedding Models](https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models-embed.html?context=wx): We will watsonx text embedding models to convert our knowledge base data into a word embedding space. This will allow us to perform similarity searches and clustering on the data, thus enabling us to provide more relevant search results to our users and improve the speed of our search engine.
- [llama-3-70b-instruct](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models): The llama-3-70b-instruct model provided by watsonx AI will be used for the following purposes:
  - **Converting Questions**: When the user asks a question, we will use the llama-3-70b-instruct model to convert the question into codes that can be understood by our climate model. This will allow us to provide more accurate and relevant answers to the user's questions.
  - **Generating Answers**: The backend of our product will return the generated answers to the user's questions, along with the information from the knowledge base. The llama-3-70b-instruct model will be used to generate these answers based on these information to address the user's queries in a human-like manner.
- [Multi-model AI](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai): The image can carry important information, or help users to understand the content better. We will develop a multi-modal AI system that can process both text and image data. This will allow us to provide more comprehensive and accurate answers to the user's questions, and improve the overall user experience of our product.
- [watsonx.data](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data): We will use watsonx.data to store and manage the knowledge base data of our product. This will allow us to easily access and update the data.
- [watsonx-governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance): We will use watsonx-governance to monitor and manage the usage of our product and evaluate the performance of our climate model. This will help us to improve the quality of our product and provide better services to our users.
